# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
Common Algos and DS Stuffs using Python3
# Description
Algorithms and Data Structures are basic building blocks for any computer programmer. Without knowledge of Algorithms and DS, it may not be possible for one to write efficient programs. However, for any self-taught programmer who have not attended a Computer Science program in an University (like me), it is often difficult to find the right materials to implement these stuffs, especially in Python.  

This repository will contain python-3 implementation of all the fundamental algorithms and data structures with proper documentation. 

# Note
Familiarity with Python 3 is required.
